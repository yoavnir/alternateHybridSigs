         A Hybrid Signature Method with Strong Non-Separability
                       draft-ietf-tls-tlsflags-06

Abstract

   This document presents an alternative scheme of composing classic and
   post-quantum signature algorithms with different security properties.
   This scheme produces signatures with strong non-separability (SNS) at
   the cost of breaking backward compatibility with legacy cryptographic
   hardware.

1.  Introduction

   With the looming threat of cryptographically relevant quantum
   computers (CRQC) breaking existing public key constructs such as
   digital signatures, the world in general and the IETF in particular
   are looking to transition to so-called post-quantum algorithms,
   algorithms that are thought to be secure against a cryptanalytic
   attack by a quantum computer.

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been
   running a project for selecting post-quantum algorithms since 2016
   ([NIST-PQC]).  This project is not complete at the time of this
   writing.  It has produced several finalists including Crystals-
   Dilithium ([Dilithium]), Falcon, and more.

   There is, however, concern about deploying these new algorithms as
   full replacements for the existing (or "classic") algorithms.  On the
   one had there is the fear that researchers or nation-state
   adversaries will produce a CRQC that will allow them to break the
   classic algorithms such as RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA.  On the other hand,
   there is still doubt about the security of the new algorithms.  This
   doubt is well-founded: One of the candidate algorithms, SIKE, was
   broken in late stages of the competition [SIKE-BREAK].

   To minimize the risks or relying on a single algorithm, there are
   some proposals for combining two or more algorithms, typically a
   classic algorithm and a post-quantum algorithm, such that all of the
   algorithms are used to create the signature, and some or all of them

   are used to verify the signature.  This has the advantage that unless
   the adversary is able to break all of the algorithms, a verifier who
   uses all of the algorithms will not be fooled.  One such proposal is
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs].

   Most such proposals involve independently signing with the several
   algorithms, each having their own private/public key pair.  With
   these schemes the private key is a concatenation or a vector of the
   private keys of the several algorithms, and similarly the public key
   is a vector of the public keys, and the signature is a vector of
   independent signatures.  A signature like that is said to be
   parallel, as there is no dependency between the signature algorithms.

   This draft proposes alternate schemes where specific algorithms are
   combined to create signatures that are non-separable, meaning that it
   is not possible to verify the signature using just one algorithm.
   This is based on the article A Note on Hybrid Signature Schemes by
   Bindel and Hale ([Bindel23]).

1.1.  Requirements and Other Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

   A hybrid signature is a signature that is created using more than one
   algorithm, typically at least one classic algorithm and at least one
   post-quantum algorithm.

1.2.  Strong Non-Separability

   Non-separability (NS) is a property of hybrid signatures.  With non-
   separable signatures, an adversary cannot remove one of the
   signatures (typically, the one that is not broken) forcing the
   verifier to rely only on the broken algorithm.  Such an attempt would
   be detected.

   Strong Non-Separability (SNS) is a stronger property, where an
   adversary cannot convert an input hybrid signature into a single
   algorithm signature that will verify correctly.

   Simultaneous Verification (SV) is an even stronger property, that
   makes it impossible for the verifier to quit the verification after
   using just one algorithm.  The hybrid signatures presented in this
   draft all require SV.

1.3.  Backward Compatibility

   Backward Compatibility for hybrid signatures means that old verifying
   hardware or software that verifies the signature of one algorithm or
   the other can be used to verify the single-algorithm component of the
   hybrid signature.  So the EdDSA component of a Dilithium-EdDSA hybrid
   signature can be verified using an EdDSA verifier.

   SNS and backward compatibility are mutually exclusive, meaning that
   to gain SNS, we have to give up on having backward compatibility.

2.  Hybrid Schemes

2.1.  Fiat-Shamir and Fiat-Shamit

   TODO: A paragraph explaining what is a Fiat-Shamir signature.

   TODO: Say that some post-quantum algorithms (like Dilithium) and some
   classic algorithms (like ECDSA and EdDSA) are FS.

   TODO: Describe the FS-FS construction.

2.2.  Fiat-Shamir and RSA

   TODO: A paragraph explaining that RSA is popular, and that Dilithium-
   RSA is desirable

   TODO: Add the FS-RSA construction (but not in draft -00)

2.3.  Fiat-Shamir and Falcon

   TODO: Add the FS-Falcon construction (but not in draft -00)

2.4.  RSA and Falcon

   TODO: Add the RSA-Falcon construction (but not in draft -00)

2.5.  IANA Considerations

   To Be Added.  We need at least OIDs for the combinations above.

3.  Comparison with Other Proposals

   TODO: Add here a discussion of the differences between this proposal
   and draft-ounsworth.  Need to cover both advantages (SNS, SV) and
   disadvantages: backward compatibility.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations appear in this document, specifically in
   Section 1.2, when discussing SNS.  Proofs of the security of the
   constructions described in Section 2 are given in the article.
